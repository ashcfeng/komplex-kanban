# Team 24: Fall 2024 Midterm Project

# Komplex Kanban

Komplex Kanban is our take on a complex number library for C++. 
We utilized the Kanban approach to software engineering to coordinate the 2-week long project.
Our library supports all basic mathematical operations for complex numbers in the form a+bi, along with further mathematical functions like logarithms and trigonometry.

## Getting Started

To start, download our library, including all its functions, and run on an IDE and operating system of your choice.

### Prerequisites

Be sure to download CMakeLists.txt in /src.
Our unit tests use Catch2, which allows for compiling and running assertions via command line prompts.
One option is to open the project on Replit, which comes with a compiler and a command line interface.

A final step is to clone our Github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/LasaACP/komplexkanbanv3-team24
```

### Installing

Besides a C++ compiler and IDE, nothing further is reqiured for installation. 
Please refer to [GNU Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to install a compiler and standard libraries.
Our mathematical functions use the CMath library.

## Running the tests

### Compiling
Run Catch2 tests by compiling in the shell.
Make sure to have a cpp file with test assertions, catch_amalgamated.o, and catch_amalgamated.cpp.
You can use the provided test runners, named after each contributor, or create your own.

Example of compiling a test file with catch amalgamated and g++:
```
g++ (name)_test.cpp ../tests/catch_amalgamated.o
```
(name)_test.cpp must include all functions used in test cases.

As an alternative, list all functions to be tested in the command itself:
```
g++ (name)_test.cpp ../lib/(EXAMPLE1).cpp ../lib/(EXAMPLE2).cpp ../tests/catch_amalgamated.o
```

### Running

Test all your assertions in the format REQUIRE(a == b) in the main test file by running a.out.
a.out is a file created by compiling.

```
./a.out
```

## Deployment

No additional steps are required to deploy our project. 
Issues related to Catch2 can be found [here](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

```
The directory tree can be generated by the linux **tree** command.  You may need to add this to the REPL NIX environment (install tree.out).

Sources go in [src/](src/), header files in [include/](include/), main programs in [app/](app), and
tests go in [tests/](tests/) (compiled to `unit_tests` by default).

If you add a new executable, say `app/hello.cpp`, you only need to add the following two lines to [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt):

```cmake
add_executable(main app/main.cpp)   # Name of exec. and location of file.
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${LIBRARY_NAME})  # Link the executable to lib built from src/*.cpp (if it uses it).
```

You can find the example source code that builds the `main` executable in [app/main.cpp](app/main.cpp) under the `Build` section in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt).
If the executable you made does not use the library in [src/](src), then only the first line is needed.


## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
make
./main
make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```

## .gitignore

The [.gitignore](.gitignore) file is a copy of the [Github C++.gitignore file](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/C%2B%2B.gitignore),
with the addition of ignoring the build directory (`build/`).
